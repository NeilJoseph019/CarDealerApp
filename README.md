# CarDealerApp

#### About this project:

This is a simple and user-friendly React-NextJS application, where people can look for car information with which they can make the decision to either buy a call or rent a car or sell their car. This project uses cars API from `RapidAPI` (link : https://rapidapi.com/apininjas/api/cars-by-api-ninjas) in-order to get the car information and to be displayed. For styling purposes, Tailwind css is used as it's much easier and faster way to develop the design for the project.

### Learned while working on this project:
- One of the main stuff that could be learned by doing this was the use of `URL params` how its passed from the filter form to the backend where the API call is made to fetch the car information.
- Also worked on some features of tailwind css such as flex and grid.
